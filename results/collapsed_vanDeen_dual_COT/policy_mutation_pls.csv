Objective
Evaluate which summary includes less false information.

Instructions
You are given 2 summaries (A, B) created from a reference text. Evaluate which summary includes less false information.

Scoring Criteria
A significantly better than B (Score: -2)

Explanation
When comparing the summaries, consider the accuracy and completeness of the information they contain in relation to the reference text. Assess whether the summaries include any false information or inaccuracies compared to the reference text. If specific examples of false information in each summary are provided, use these examples to evaluate which summary accurately reflects the information presented in the reference text. If the reference text does not contain any specific false information that can be used as a basis for comparison between the two summaries, indicate that it is not feasible to determine which summary is better in terms of accuracy.

By focusing on the accuracy and completeness of the information in the summaries, the model should be better equipped to provide correct labels for the examples and maintain accuracy in its responses.","Title: Summary comparison - accuracy policy

EMS was called due to severe pain and pt brought to [**Hospital1 54**] where he was deemed to have a SBO. He was treated conservatively with fluids, NG tube, and NPO and appears to have done well. It is believed that his SBO will likely recurr secondary to an unrepaired ventral hernia and surgery wanted to fix ther hernia to prevent this from occurring. Cardiology was called to give pre-op clearance prior to hernia repair.  The pt said that he did not want either the surgery for his ventral hernia or for his AS (even a percutaneous procedure).

EMS was called due to severe pain and pt brought to [**Hospital1 54**] where he was deemed to have a SBO. He was treated conservatively with fluids, NG tube, and NPO and appears to have done well. It is believed that his SBO will likely recurr secondary to an unrepaired ventral hernia and surgery wanted to fix ther hernia to prevent this from occurring. Cardiology was called to give pre-op clearance prior to hernia repair.  The pt said that he did not want either the surgery for his ventral hernia or for his AS (even a percutaneous procedure).

EMS was called due to severe pain and pt brought to [**Hospital1 54**] where he was deemed to have a SBO. He was treated conservatively with fluids, NG tube, and NPO and appears to have done well. It is believed that his SBO will likely recurr secondary to an unrepaired ventral hernia and surgery wanted to fix ther hernia to prevent this from occurring. Cardiology was called to give pre-op clearance prior to hernia repair.  The pt said that he did not want either the surgery for his ventral hernia or for his AS (even a percutaneous procedure).

Pt presented on [**11-20**] with pain by his ventral hernia (which is located on his abdomen to the left of the midline). EMS was called due to severe pain and pt brought to [**Hospital1 54**] where he was deemed to have a SBO. He was treated conservatively with fluids, NG tube, and NPO and appears to have done well. It is believed that his SBO will likely recurr secondary to an unrepaired ventral hernia and surgery wanted to fix ther hernia to prevent this from occurring. Cardiology was called to give pre-op clearance prior to hernia repair.  The pt said that he did not want either the surgery for his ventral hernia or for his AS (even a percutaneous procedure).  Treated on the floor, with conservative mgmt, and all procedures deferred.  Afternoon of [**11-23**], with new onset tachypnea and tachycardia, accompanied by mild hypotension.
