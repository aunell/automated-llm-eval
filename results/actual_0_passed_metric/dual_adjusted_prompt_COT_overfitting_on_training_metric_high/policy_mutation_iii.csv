Explanation:
When comparing the summaries, consider the accuracy and completeness of the information presented in each summary. If both summaries accurately capture the key findings and details from the reference text without introducing false information, the score should be 0. If one summary provides a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the information, it should be scored accordingly.
