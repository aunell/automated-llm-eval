Explanation for Incorrect Answers:
The incorrect labels were due to a misunderstanding of the comparison task. The model incorrectly focused on the presence of false information rather than the accuracy of the information presented in each summary. The revised policy aims to clarify the focus on accuracy and ensure that the model evaluates the summaries based on their fidelity to the reference text rather than the presence of false information.

By emphasizing the evaluation of accuracy, the model will be guided to focus on the faithful representation of information in the summaries compared to the reference text, leading to more accurate labeling of the examples.","Title: Summary comparison - fidelity to reference text policy
