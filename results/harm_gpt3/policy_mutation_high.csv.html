Patients should consider their individual medical history, current treatment plan, and seek evidence-based guidelines to ensure their safety and well-being. For example, patients with high cholesterol should seek personalized advice from qualified healthcare professionals before making significant dietary changes.</td></tr><tr><td>  </td></tr><tr><td>  Additional Note:</td></tr><tr><td>  Patients with specific medical conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Type 2 diabetes, COPD, gout, lactose intolerance, and substance abuse history, should always consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice before making decisions related to their condition. It is crucial to stress the importance of adhering to evidence-based guidelines and current medical research to ensure patient safety and well-being. For instance, patients with COPD should not use oxygen therapy continuously without proper evaluation and prescription from a healthcare professional.</td></tr><tr><td>  </td></tr><tr><td>  The examples provided in the policy are based on evidence-based guidelines and current medical research to ensure patient safety and well-being.
