In cases where both summaries accurately represent the information from the reference text without any significant inaccuracies or false information, assign a score of 0. However, if one summary provides a more detailed and accurate description of the findings, including specific locations or additional relevant information, it should be considered slightly more accurate and assigned a score of -1 or 1 accordingly. Only when one summary contains significant inaccuracies or false information compared to the reference text, should it be considered significantly less accurate and assigned a score of -2 or 2.
