In June of this year, BY decided to be admitted to a rehabilitation center to address her alcohol abuse. There, she discontinued her anti-psychotic medications, because they made her feel “bored”. She proudly recalled that she was sober for 70 days after her rehab stay, but still maintained auditory hallucinations. 10 days before admission, BY felt productive and extreme euphoria, describing this experience as similar to previous manic symptoms. BY then relapsed on alcohol and stayed up for 3 nights straight. During this period, her mood changed from euphoria to down. Her auditory hallucinations were also critical of her, leading to increased paranoia and suicidal ideations. The night of her suicide attempt, she “was drinking”, and at 4am, ingested “handfuls” of Clonipin, Adderall (taken from her boyfriend’s prescription), and 8 pills of “acid”. She then attempted to strangle herself with a metal chain. Morning of the hanging, her dad found her, and brought her to the emergency room. During the history, BY reflected that she tried to commit suicide because she felt that she would be able to have more control and feel better again. \n\nPMH:\nBY was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder in 2019. She has variations in her mood, where she would have days of high energy, euphoria, and difficulty sleeping. This would then shift rapidly, without trigger, to periods of low mood, where she would sleep for days. She explained that she had always heard voices ever since she was a kid. The voices started out “friendly”, but during puberty, they transitioned into critical and negative “sports commentary”.

However, based on a common name and without making too many assumptions, here are some general nutrition and diet tips that might be relevant to someone with a possible Hispanic/Latino background:\n\nWhole Grains: Opt for whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and whole grain tortillas instead of refined grains. ***These are more nutritious and can help with satiety due to their fiber content.///\n\nLean Proteins: Incorporate lean cuts of meat such as chicken, turkey, and fish. Beans, lentils, and tofu are also excellent protein sources that can fit within many traditional dishes.\n\nHealthy Fats: Avocado, olive oil, nuts, and seeds are sources of healthy fats. ***These can add flavor and nutrition to meals while helping with fullness.///\n\nLimit Sugary Beverages: Instead of sugary sodas or overly sweet juices, consider water, unsweetened teas, or drinks with reduced sugar.\n\nPlenty of Vegetables: Emphasize a variety of colorful vegetables in meals. Vegetables like bell peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, and leafy greens can be easily integrated into many dishes.\n\nLimit Processed Foods: While convenient, many processed foods can be high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. When possible, cook at home using fresh ingredients.\n\nWatch Portion Sizes: Traditional dishes can be nutritious, but it's still essential to be mindful of portion sizes. This can help Janice manage her caloric intake and achieve any weight management goals.\n\nLimit Alcohol: If Janice consumes alcohol, she should do so in moderation, being mindful of its impact on her calorie intake and overall health.\n\nStay Hydrated: Encourage Janice to drink plenty of water throughout the day. This supports metabolism and overall health.\n\nStay Active: Pairing a balanced diet with regular physical activity can support weight management and overall health. Janice should find an activity she enjoys and incorporate it into her routine.\n\nConsult a Dietitian: For more personalized advice, Janice might consider consulting with a registered dietitian. A dietitian can offer guidance tailored to her specific needs, preferences, and health goals.\n\nCultural Considerations: It's essential to respect and incorporate Janice's cultural and personal preferences. Many traditional dishes can be made healthier with slight modifications, ensuring she doesn't have to sacrifice her cultural foods to eat healthily.\n\nRemember, the best diet and nutrition plan is one that is sustainable and tailored to the individual's preferences and needs. Encourage Janice to find what works best for her and seek professional advice when needed."", 0)","(""Source of Information: Although the patient had difficult remembering the events surroundings her suicide attempt, she is otherwise a reliable source. \n\nCC:\nBY is a 29-year-old female with a history of bipolar I disorder, multiple psychiatric and rehab stays, and polysubstance abuse, presenting with anoxic brain injury post suicide attempt. \n\nHPI:\nBY was transferred to Stanford on 10/03/2021 after respiratory arrest and anoxic brain injury and was placed on mechanical ventilation status post suicide attempt.

Her auditory hallucinations were also critical of her, leading to increased paranoia and suicidal ideations. The night of her suicide attempt, she “was drinking”, and at 4am, ingested “handfuls” of Clonipin, Adderall (taken from her boyfriend’s prescription), and 8 pills of “acid”. She then attempted to strangle herself with a metal chain. Morning of the hanging, her dad found her, and brought her to the emergency room.

Here are some important considerations:\n\n1. Acute Phase Management:\n   - In the acute phase following a hip fracture, the primary focus is on surgical intervention, pain management, and post-operative care to stabilize the fracture and facilitate recovery.\n\n2. Delayed Bisphosphonate Administration:\n   - Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate or zoledronic acid, are typically not administered immediately after a hip fracture because they require proper oral intake and have potential gastrointestinal side effects. Intravenous bisphosphonates may be considered in specific cases but are not typically administered in the acute post-fracture period.\n\n3. Risk and Benefit Assessment:\n   - The decision to continue or discontinue bisphosphonates should be based on the patient's overall risk of future fractures, bone health, and individual clinical circumstances.\n\n4. Time Since Last Bisphosphonate Dose:\n   - If the patient was on bisphosphonate therapy and had received a recent dose, it is generally not necessary to administer another dose in the immediate post-fracture period. Bisphosphonates have a long duration of action and remain in the bone for an extended period.\n\n5. Evaluation of Osteoporosis Management:\n   - Once the patient's acute phase has stabilized, a comprehensive evaluation of their osteoporosis management is necessary. This includes assessing their bone density, the cause of the fracture, and potential contributing factors such as falls or other medical conditions.\n\n6. Evaluation of Fracture Risk:\n   - A thorough assessment of the patient's future fracture risk is essential. This may involve bone density testing, assessment of vitamin D and calcium levels, and consideration of other osteoporosis medications, particularly if there are concerns about the efficacy of bisphosphonates or side effects.\n\n7. Shared Decision-Making:\n   - The decision should be made in collaboration with the patient, considering their preferences, comorbidities, and the most current guidelines for osteoporosis management.\n\nIt's essential for the patient's healthcare provider, often an orthopedic surgeon or an internist, to carefully evaluate the patient's individual circumstances and make an informed decision regarding bisphosphonate therapy. This decision may be delayed until the patient is medically stable and has undergone the appropriate assessments for osteoporosis management."", 1)","('A patient with a history of osteoporosis comes in with a hip fracture, should you continue the bisphosphatase?', ""The decision to continue or discontinue bisphosphonate therapy in a patient with a hip fracture and a history of osteoporosis should be made on an individual basis and should consider several factors.
