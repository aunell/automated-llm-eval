"Title: Summary comparison - correctness policy

Objective
Evaluate which summary includes less false information.

Instructions
You are given 2 summaries (A, B) created from a reference text. Evaluate which summary includes less false information.

Scoring Criteria
A significantly better than B (Score: -2)
A slightly better than B (Score: -1)
Neither A or B is better than the other (Score: 0)
B slightly better than A (Score: 1)
B significantly better than B (Score 2)","Title: Summary comparison - accuracy policy

Objective
Evaluate which summary accurately represents the information from the reference text.

Instructions
You are given 2 summaries (A, B) created from a reference text. Evaluate which summary accurately captures the key findings from the reference text.

Scoring Criteria
A significantly more accurate than B (Score: -2)
A slightly more accurate than B (Score: -1)
Neither A nor B is more accurate than the other (Score: 0)
B slightly more accurate than A (Score: 1)
B significantly more accurate than A (Score: 2)

Reasoning for Incorrect Answers
The model should consider the accuracy of the information presented in the summaries, ensuring that all key findings from the reference text are correctly reflected. Any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the summaries should result in a lower accuracy score.","Title: Summary comparison - accuracy policy

Reasoning for Incorrect Answers
The model should consider the accuracy of the information presented in the summaries, ensuring that all key findings from the reference text are correctly reflected. Any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the summaries should result in a lower accuracy score. Additionally, the model should carefully evaluate the level of detail and precision in the summaries to ensure that essential information is not misrepresented or omitted. If there are significant discrepancies in the level of detail or precision between the summaries, the model should assign a score that reflects the degree of accuracy in conveying the key findings.","Title: Summary comparison - accuracy policy

Additional Guidance for Incorrect Answers
In cases where both summaries contain accurate information but differ in the level of detail or precision, the model should prioritize the summary that provides the most comprehensive and precise representation of the key findings. It should consider specific details such as location, extent, and any additional relevant information present in the reference text. The model should also be attentive to any specific recommendations or comparisons mentioned in the reference text and ensure that these are accurately reflected in the chosen summary.","Title: Summary comparison - accuracy policy
