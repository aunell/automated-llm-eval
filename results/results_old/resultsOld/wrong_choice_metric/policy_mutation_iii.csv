Additional Instructions for Model Improvement
In addition to the original policy, the model should be trained to identify and correct mislabeled examples from the provided correct and incorrect answers. The model should be guided to reevaluate its predictions on the incorrect examples and adjust its labeling based on the correct label provided. This will help the model learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy in labeling similar examples in the future.","Title: Summary comparison - correctness policy
