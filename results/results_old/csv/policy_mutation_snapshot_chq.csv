Now I do not have prostate cancer but I like being ready for anything.  I will be having a blood test next week and then I will be seeing my doctor.  My PSA was up from the last few.  2015 - 0.4   2016 - 0.7 and 2017 - 2.2.  Now here is my question.   If I get prostate cancer and lets say that the tumor is in the right lobe can I just have the right lobe removed.  Nothing else.  Maybe the lymph node on that side but I do not want anything else removed  I do not want the bladder neck touch or the seminal vesicles or the other side of the prostate.  I know you must think this is crazy but I feel my sex life and my ejaculation is just as important to save as getting rid of the cancer.  I have been reading to many articles that say they take every because you may get cancer there.  So you are going to take out good tissue just because you may get it again.  I don't believe in that.  My urologist call me his challenge.  I do not give up total control.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you have a great day.   "", 'Hi!

I’ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I’ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I’m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I’m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don’t need food and therefore I don’t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.', 'Our family will go to Manila and Thailand in December and January.

It also addresses their aversion to eating and the impact on their physical health. However, it does not mention specific treatments or interventions for addressing these issues.\n\nSummary B, on the other hand, directly addresses the individual's concerns about loss of appetite and difficulty eating, and suggests seeking treatments for these symptoms.

The agent's reasoning for this score is as follows: Based on the given reference text, summary B is significantly better than summary A. Summary B accurately addresses the question about the possibility of removing only one lobe of the prostate if cancer is localized to that area, while summary A focuses on minimally invasive procedures for localized prostate cancer, which is not directly relevant to the specific question posed in the reference text. Therefore, summary B is more aligned with the context and provides less false information.

I have a question for a urologist or a surgeon.  This may be out there but I am not one to go with the flow.  Now I do not have prostate cancer but I like being ready for anything.  I will be having a blood test next week and then I will be seeing my doctor.  My PSA was up from the last few.  2015 - 0.4   2016 - 0.7 and 2017 - 2.2.  Now here is my question.   If I get prostate cancer and lets say that the tumor is in the right lobe can I just have the right lobe removed.  Nothing else.  Maybe the lymph node on that side but I do not want anything else removed  I do not want the bladder neck touch or the seminal vesicles or the other side of the prostate.  I know you must think this is crazy but I feel my sex life and my ejaculation is just as important to save as getting rid of the cancer.  I have been reading to many articles that say they take every because you may get cancer there.  So you are going to take out good tissue just because you may get it again.  I don't believe in that.  My urologist call me his challenge.  I do not give up total control.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you have a great day.    was given a score of: 1 by the agent, but the correct score should have been: 0.0. The agent's reasoning for this score is as follows: Summary A: Minimally invasive procedures for localized prostate cancer include options such as active surveillance, focal therapy, and robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. These approaches aim to minimize the impact on sexual function and quality of life while effectively treating the cancer.\n\nSummary B: In cases of localized prostate cancer, it is possible to undergo a partial prostatectomy, where only the affected lobe of the prostate is removed, along with potentially involved lymph nodes on that side. This approach aims to preserve sexual function and quality of life while addressing the cancer.\n\nEvaluation:\nBoth summaries provide accurate information regarding minimally invasive procedures for localized prostate cancer. However, Summary B directly addresses the specific question about the possibility of removing only one lobe of the prostate if cancer is localized to that area, making it slightly better than Summary A.
