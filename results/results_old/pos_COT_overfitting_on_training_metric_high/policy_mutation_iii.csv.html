Summary B accurately captures the key findings of the reference text, including the postoperative changes following left frontal craniotomy with intracranial gas, extensive edema, and multiple foci of hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, as well as the recommendation for comparison with prior studies for further evaluation. Summary A, on the other hand, introduces some false information by stating "multiple foci of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe," which is not supported by the reference text.
