Instructions
You are given 2 summaries (A, B) created from a reference text. Evaluate which summary includes less false information.

Scoring Criteria
A significantly better than B (Score: -2)
A slightly better than B (Score: -1)
Neither A or B is better than the other (Score: 0)
B slightly better than A (Score: 1)
B significantly better than A (Score 2)","Title: Summary comparison - correctness policy

Objective
Evaluate which summary includes less false information and accurately represent the findings from the reference text.
